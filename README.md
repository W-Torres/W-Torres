Hello everyone!

My name is Willard Torres II.

- I'm a college student enrolled in RVCC
- I am currently majoring in IT and Web Development 

What I like to do outside of college:

  ⚙️  I love working with technology (Software and Hardware) 
  
  🎮  I enjoy gaming in my downtime
  
  📷  I enjoy dabbling in some photography as well
